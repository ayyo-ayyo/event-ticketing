## What We Built

[One or two paragraphs. What is running? What does `docker compose up` produce? What endpoints are live?]

## Individual Contributions

| Team Member | What They Delivered                                     | Key Commits            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [Name]      | [e.g. order-service with DB schema, health endpoint]    | [short SHA or PR link] |
| [Name]      | [e.g. restaurant-service, synchronous call integration] |                        |
| [Name]      | [e.g. compose.yml wiring, k6 baseline script]           |                        |
| Maycol M      | Finish setting the ticket purshcase service and made db for it           |     5dcf088a81be18773fa7281984e8c26e1cabd49e, and 1beb13e7a1f92d34073a39de9840465d604623ef                   |

| Mateus      | Event Catalog service foundation: Postgres schema bootstrap (`venues`, `events`, `seat_inventory`), Redis integration, `GET /health`, and working `GET /events/:id` endpoint with cache-first behavior |                        |

## What Is Working

- [ ] `docker compose up` starts all services without errors
- [ ] `docker compose ps` shows every service as `(healthy)`
- [ ] `GET /health` on every service returns `200` with DB and Redis status
- [ ] At least one synchronous service-to-service call works end-to-end
- [ ] k6 baseline test runs successfully

## What Is Not Working / Cut

[Be honest. What did you not finish? What did you cut from the sprint plan and why? How will you address it in Sprint 2?]

## k6 Baseline Results

Script: `k6/sprint-1.js`  
Run: `docker compose exec holmes k6 run /workspace/k6/sprint-1.js`

```
[Paste the k6 summary output here]
```

| Metric             | Value |
| ------------------ | ----- |
| p50 response time  |       |
| p95 response time  |       |
| p99 response time  |       |
| Requests/sec (avg) |       |
| Error rate         |       |

These numbers are your baseline. Sprint 2 caching should improve them measurably.
